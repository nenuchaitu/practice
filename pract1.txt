Working hard feeling blue...
working hard feeling blue...
working hard feeling blue...

orange is the sky color that I see from my window when sun shines through
but i feel blue as it reminds me that i haven't eaten any mangoes this year from our own garden
I know it's stupid to feel blue about mangoes
